   - **Mitigation**: Phase security implementation, start with MVP and iterate

3. **Performance at Scale**: Complex multi-agent workflows may be too slow
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing early, caching strategies, query optimization

### **Medium-Risk Items**
1. **MCP Client Integration**: Existing v2 client may need modifications
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, wrapper approach to preserve existing functionality

2. **User Experience Complexity**: Business users may find interface confusing
   - **Mitigation**: User testing with representative personas, iterative UI improvements
