## 🚨 RISKS & MITIGATION

### **High-Risk Items**
1. **LLM Model Discovery Accuracy**: Risk that Claude 4.0 doesn't reliably map entities to fields
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing, fallback mechanisms, human-in-the-loop validation

2. **Security Implementation Complexity**: Enterprise security requirements may slow development
   - **Mitigation**: Phase security implementation, start with MVP and iterate

3. **Performance at Scale**: Complex multi-agent workflows may be too slow
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing early, caching strategies, query optimization

### **Medium-Risk Items**
1. **MCP Client Integration**: Existing v2 client may need modifications
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, wrapper approach to preserve existing functionality

2. **User Experience Complexity**: Business users may find interface confusing
   - **Mitigation**: User testing with representative personas, iterative UI improvements

---

## 🔄 ITERATION STRATEGY

### **Agile Approach**
- **Sprint Length**: 1-week sprints within each phase
- **Demo Frequency**: Working demo at end of each phase
- **Feedback Loops**: Regular testing with Steve Jobs/Alex Smith personas

### **MVP-First Development**
1. **Core MVP**: Basic query → response pipeline working
2. **Security MVP**: Basic RBAC and jailbreak prevention
3. **Demo MVP**: Polished interface for executive demonstration
4. **Production MVP**: Full security, monitoring, and documentation
